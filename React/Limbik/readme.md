# Neo4j Movie Extractor

This is a demonstration application highlighting the implementation of a fullstack application that relies on React to extract Neo4J sample movie data, using Node.js as a backend.

## Installation instructions

There are two folders, one for the client and one for the server
For each of the folders, perform a `npm install`. The client and server relies on several NPM libraries like Axios, Props, and Express to run.

## How to run locally

On the server folder, run `node app.js`. This starts the Node.js server on the localhost, port 8000.
On the client folder, run `npm start`, in which the deployment server is deployed on port 3000.
